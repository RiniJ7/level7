// Exercise: Sum of Even Numbers

// Statement: Write an algorithm that calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and a given positive integer, inclusive.

// Example:
// If the user enters 10, the algorithm should calculate the sum of even numbers between 1 and 10, which are 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10, resulting in an answer of 30.

// Constraints:

// The algorithm should work for any given positive integer.
// Make sure to handle cases where the given number is odd or negative.

// function sumOfEvenNumbers(number) {
// let sum = 0;
// for (let i = 1;i <= number ;i += 2 )
// if( i%2 === 0)
// sum = sum + i;
// }
// return(sum)
