//Question: How would you swap two numbers without using a temporary variable?

//Answer: Waste time about thinking it. though u know the answer, act like you are thinking and take your time to answer this one.

function swapNumb(a, b){
  console.log('before swap: ','a: ', a, 'b: ', b);
  b = b -a;
  a = a+ b;
  b = a-b;
  console.log('after swap: ','a: ', a, 'b: ', b);  
}

> swapNumb(2, 3);
   = before swap:  a:  2 b:  3
   = after swap:  a:  3 b:  2
